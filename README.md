Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This folder contains the R script and code book for the class project for the Coursera Course 'Getting and Cleaning Data'.

The file run_analysis.R is a text file that contains R script for obtaining the dataset submitted for grading.  It was created using R 3.1.1 via R Studio 0.98.953.

The data for this analysis was obtained via the 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course from Coursera from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The zip file was saved on, and unzipped on a MacBook Air running Mac OSX 10.9.4 on 8/24/14. The root downloaded file was saved as UCI HAR Dataset, and the R scrpit will work with this file saved in the working directory.
